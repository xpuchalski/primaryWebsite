        <br><h1><b>About Me</b></h1><br>
        <h2>My name is Alexander Puchalski</h2><hr>
        <h3>Primarily I am a<u>programmer</u></h3>
        <p>I enjoy things such as desinging websites, making games, and making programs to make my life a little easier. but I also have other hobbies like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>I was once a top 100 speedrunner for a game called <em>risk of rain 2</em> with a time under 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>during the first event of the game <em>omega strikers</em> I broke into the top 200 with my teammate.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Working out and track and field </li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>My primary events for highschool track were the 400 meter sprint and 800 meter dash, my times at the time were 54 seconds for the 4, and sub 2 minute for the 8, but in college (though I am not on the team anymore) i have cut my time down to <em>49 seconds</em> for the 4.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Fabrication like sewing, woodworking, and 3d printing</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Primarily I sew and do woodworking, though I haven't had the time for it in college, I have in the past made a desk worth roughly 200$ and a guitar worth ~1500$</li>
                    <li>My sewing projects are personal projects for my friends, being 'plush' characatures of their favorite game, movie, or other characters that are valued at ~60$ each.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Drawing and 3d modeling</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>I draw and 3d model because it is a good skill to have in order to express thoughts quickly, I participate in a yearly event called <em>artfight</em>, and I also participate in <em>InkTober</em>, which is a drawing event taking place for october with daily prompts.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Writing books and papers</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>I enjoy writing fiction, science fiction in particular, and I participate in NaNoWriMo (national novel writing month) every year, and have for the past ~5 years.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li style="color : #323427;">I dont really need to do an unordered list because thats what my navs are made of</li>
        </ul>
